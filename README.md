Pirkl is a game I made when I was first learning javascript in August of 2015.

In Pirkl, you play as a green circle that can grow by eating smaller yellow circles but can also be eaten by larger red circles. The goal of the game is to simply eat everything. The larger you become the slower you get, however you can hold the spacebar button to increase your speed, but this will also temporarily decrease your size.

Movement is controlled by WASD keys. The music is turned off by default but you can go into the options menu to turn it back on.
